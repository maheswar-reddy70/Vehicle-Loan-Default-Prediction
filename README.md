# Vehicle-Loan-Default-Prediction

Vehicle Loan Default Prediction

About the Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to default on a vehicle loan. The idea is to help banks or financial companies make better loan approval decisions using data.

I worked on this project to understand how machine learning can be used in risk analysis and finance.

Dataset

Contains 8000+ vehicle loan records

Includes customer details such as:

Income

Credit score

Loan-to-value ratio

Employment and loan-related information

The dataset was cleaned and prepared before applying any machine learning models.

What I Did

Cleaned the data by handling missing values and inconsistencies

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and risk factors

Applied feature engineering to improve model performance

Trained and tested multiple machine learning models

Compared results to select the best-performing model

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

 XGBoost performed the best with a ROC-AUC score of 0.87

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

MySQL

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Results

Identified key factors that influence loan default

Built a reliable model for predicting default risk

Visualized performance using ROC curves and confusion matrix

Use Case

This project can be useful for:

Banks

NBFCs

Financial institutions

to support credit risk analysis and loan approval decisions.
